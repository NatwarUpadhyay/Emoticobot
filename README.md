# Emoticobot




Trying to Secure Information on creating a free-for-all, effective "Emotional AI" , for keeping individual's mental issues at bay, as the present AI like Replika, Woebot, Wysa, Tess, Joy and many more, are trained to assess the emotion but in a very limited way, due to lack of training data,their design and interface.




My idea solves the major advancement in the Healthcare Department because most of the population is facing different types of increasing mental illnesses due to which a relevant pace is required for coping with this dire situation.
According to WHO, Mental health conditions are increasing worldwide. Mainly because of demographic changes, there has been a 13% rise in mental health conditions and substance use disorders in the last decade (to 2017). Mental health conditions now cause 1 in 5 years lived with disability. Around 20% of the world’s children and adolescents have a mental health condition, with suicide the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. Approximately one in five people in post-conflict settings have a mental health condition.
My personal motivation behind this idea is that I have seen many close ones getting critically impacted because of a lack of mental health awareness and even if they are aware, they are not ready to get remedy because it’s simply not physical and they think it will get better with time, some are shy admitting it in front of everyone thinking what other will think (i.e. over-thinking). I have seen solid stereotypes when it comes to admitting mental health issues, even if someone admits it, and starts getting treated or going through any kind of rehabilitation, then other thinks that the person is mentally weak and pre-judged and even sometimes laughed at because of having this kind of treatment. 
So the main idea behind bringing these kinds of bots with effective skills trained by not only software developers but also medical experts, so that we can bring anonymity and accessibility to almost every individual who will be able to self-treat themselves without any prejudices, or time loss. Though the Virtual Sessions along with Medical Experts are very effective to keep this situation checked, I am sure that we can harness the newer GPT-4 version AI’s power and expect to see such ideas coming to life and deliver a personalized, scalable and cost-effective solution for the affected masses.





The process consists of coordinated efforts of the technical and medical departments from identifying the target audience to releasing the application with healthcare bodies' collaboration and implementing certain policies and standards for this kind of app and its exploitation.

Identify the target audience: The first step in creating an emotional support chatbot is to identify the target audience. This will include determining the types of emotional support that are needed, as well as the demographics and needs of the users who will be accessing the chatbot.
Develop a chatbot framework: The next step is to develop a framework for the chatbot. This will involve identifying the types of interactions that the chatbot will support, as well as the types of responses and emotional support that the chatbot will provide. It will also involve developing a natural language processing (NLP) engine that can understand and interpret user inputs.
Train the chatbot: Once the framework is in place, the chatbot will need to be trained. This will involve providing the chatbot with a large volume of data and feedback that it can use to learn how to provide emotional support in a way that is appropriate for the target audience.
Test and refine the chatbot: Once the chatbot has been trained, it will need to be tested and refined. This will involve collecting feedback from users and using that feedback to improve the chatbot's performance and emotional support capabilities.
Deploy the chatbot: Once the chatbot has been tested and refined, it can be deployed in a healthcare setting. This may involve integrating the chatbot with existing healthcare systems or platforms, as well as developing processes and protocols for using the chatbot effectively.
The solution is needed in situations where individuals require emotional support but may not have access to traditional therapy or counselling services. This could include individuals who are experiencing stress, anxiety, depression, or other emotional issues related to their healthcare needs. The solution can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, making it a convenient and accessible source of emotional support.

The users of the emotional support chatbot will vary depending on the specific healthcare setting but may include patients, healthcare providers, and other healthcare professionals. The chatbot should take into account the specific needs and preferences of each user group, as well as any cultural or linguistic considerations that may be relevant. It should also be designed to provide personalized emotional support that is tailored to the needs of each individual user.
